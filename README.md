GHIDRA DWARF1 Plugin
====================

This plugin adds DWARF1 analyzer to Ghidra (built-in Ghidra DWARF analyzer does not support this version of DWARF
debug format).

I made this plugin in a short time because I neeed something to help me analyze PS2 game binaries. It may not work
with other files, probably have some bugs and is very incomplete. Use it on your own risk. I suggest making a backup
of your Ghidra database before using it.

Usage
-----

Install it like any other Ghidra extension. See https://ghidra-sre.org/InstallationGuide.html#Extensions for instructions.
